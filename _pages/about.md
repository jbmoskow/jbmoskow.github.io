I am a research scientist working for [Acuity Insights](https://acuityinsights.com), an educational technology start-up. In my current role I wear many hats, supporting data engineering, research, and psychometric analyses. 

I received my MSc and PhD in Neuroscience from [Queen's University](https://www.flanaganlab.com), where I combined the use of virtual reality displays, haptic robotics, and eye-tracking to study human motor learning and visual search behaviour. I have experience in applying scientific thinking to business problems and am a skilled (mostly self-taught) programmer, comfortable in R, Python, and SQL. I am particularly interested in working on problems relating to educational, healthcare, and wellness technology. 

Outside of work, I enjoy playing [Magic: The Gathering](https://www.moxfield.com/users/jbmoskow) and going on hikes in the mountains of British Columbia.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
